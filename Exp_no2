Step 1: Adding Files and Directories to HDFS

1. Create a directory in HDFS:

          hadoop fs -mkdir /user/myfile

This command creates a new directory named myfile in the /user directory in HDFS.

2. Add a file to HDFS:

          hadoop fs -put a.txt

This command uploads the file a.txt from the local filesystem to the root directory of 
HDFS.

3. Add the file to the newly created directory:

          hadoop fs -put a.txt /user/myfile

This command uploads the file a.txt from the local filesystem directly into 
the /user/myfile directory in HDFS.

Step 2: Retrieving Files from HDFS

          hadoop fs -cat a.txt

This command displays the contents of the file a.txt directly to the console. To actually copy the 
file to the local filesystem, you would use:

hadoop fs -get a.txt /user/hadoop
/local/path is replaced  with the desired path on your local filesystem.

Step 3: Deleting Files from HDFS
To delete a file from HDFS, use the rm command. Here’s how to delete a.txt:

          hadoop fs -rm a.txt
This command removes the file a.txt from HDFS.
