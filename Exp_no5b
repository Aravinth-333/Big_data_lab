The FILTER operator is used to select the required tuples from a relation based on a 
condition.
Given below is the syntax of the FILTER operator.
grunt> Relation2_name = FILTER Relation1_name BY (condition);

student_details.txt
001,Rajiv,Reddy,21,9848022337,Hyderabad
002,siddarth,Battacharya,22,9848022338,Kolkata
003,Rajesh,Khanna,22,9848022339,Delhi 
004,Preethi,Agarwal,21,9848022330,Pune 
005,Trupthi,Mohanthy,23,9848022336,Bhuwaneshwar 
006,Archana,Mishra,23,9848022335,Chennai 
007,Komal,Nayak,24,9848022334,trivendram 
008,Bharathi,Nambiayar,24,9848022333,Chennai

And we have loaded this file into Pig with the relation name student_details as shown 
below.

grunt> student_details = LOAD 
'hdfs://localhost:9000/pig_data/student_details.txt' USING PigStorage(',')
 as (id:int, firstname:chararray, lastname:chararray, age:int,
phone:chararray, city:chararray);

Let us now use the Filter operator to get the details of the students who belong to the city 
Chennai.
filter_data = FILTER student_details BY city == 'Chennai';

Verification
Verify the relation filter_data using the DUMP operator as shown below.
grunt> Dump filter_data;

Output
It will produce the following output, displaying the contents of the relation filter_data as 
follows.
(6,Archana,Mishra,23,9848022335,Chennai)
(8,Bharathi,Nambiayar,24,9848022333,Chennai)
