Create Database Statement
Create Database is a statement used to create a database in Hive. A database in Hive is 
a namespace or a collection of tables. The syntax for this statement is as follows:

CREATE DATABASE|SCHEMA [IF NOT EXISTS] <database name>
Here, IF NOT EXISTS is an optional clause, which notifies the user that a database with the 
same name already exists. We can use SCHEMA in place of DATABASE in this command. 

The following query is executed to create a database named userdb:
hive> CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] userdb;
or
hive> CREATE SCHEMA userdb;
The following query is used to verify a databases list:

hive> SHOW DATABASES;
default
userdb

JDBC Program
The JDBC program to create a database is given below.
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.Statement;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
public class HiveCreateDb {
 private static String driverName =
"org.apache.hadoop.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver";
 
 public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
 // Register driver and create driver instance
 
 Class.forName(driverName);
 // get connection
 
 Connection con =
DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hive://localhost:10000/default", "", "");
 Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
 
 stmt.executeQuery("CREATE DATABASE userdb");
 System.out.println(“Database userdb created successfully.”);
 
 con.close();
 }
}
The following commands are used to compile and execute this program.
$ javac HiveCreateDb.java
$ java HiveCreateDb
Output:
Database userdb created successfully.
Creating a View
You can create a view at the time of executing a SELECT statement. The syntax is as 
follows:
CREATE VIEW [IF NOT EXISTS] view_name [(column_name [COMMENT column_comment],
...) ]
[COMMENT table_comment]
AS SELECT ...

Example
Let us take an example for view. Assume employee table as given below, with the fields Id, 
Name, Salary, Designation, and Dept. Generate a query to retrieve the employee details 
who earn a salary of more than Rs 30000. We store the result in a view named emp_30000.
+------+--------------+-------------+-------------------+--------+
| ID | Name | Salary | Designation | Dept |
+------+--------------+-------------+-------------------+--------+
|1201 | Gopal | 45000 | Technical manager | TP |
|1202 | Manisha | 45000 | Proofreader | PR |
|1203 | Masthanvali | 40000 | Technical writer | TP |
|1204 | Krian | 40000 | Hr Admin | HR |
|1205 | Kranthi | 30000 | Op Admin | Admin |
+------+--------------+-------------+-------------------+--------+
The following query retrieves the employee details using the above scenario:

hive> CREATE VIEW emp_30000 AS
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE salary>30000;

Dropping a View
Use the following syntax to drop a view:

DROP VIEW view_name
The following query drops a view named as emp_30000:

hive> DROP VIEW emp_30000;
