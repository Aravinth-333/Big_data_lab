The following queries demonstrate some built-in functions:
round() function
hive> SELECT round(2.6) from temp;
successful execution of query, following response:
3.0

floor() function
hive> SELECT floor(2.6) from temp;
On successful execution of the query,following response:
2.0

ceil() function
hive> SELECT ceil(2.6) from temp;
On successful execution of the query,following response:
3.0

Aggregate Functions
Hive supports the following built-in aggregate functions. The usage of these functions is as same as the SQL aggregate functions.
Return Type Signature Description
BIGINT count(*), 
count(expr),
count(*) - Returns the total number of retrieved 
rows.

DOUBLE sum(col), 
sum(DISTINCT col)
It returns the sum of the elements in the group or 
the sum of the distinct values of the column in 
the group.

DOUBLE avg(col), 
avg(DISTINCT col)
It returns the average of the elements in the group or the average of the distinct values of the column in the group.
DOUBLE min(col) It returns the minimum value of the column in the group.
DOUBLE max(col) It returns the maximum value of the column in the group.
Creating an Index
An Index is nothing but a pointer on a particular column of a table. Creating an index means creating a pointer on a particular column of a table. Its syntax is as follows:
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON TABLE base_table_name (col_name, ...)
AS 'index.handler.class.name'
[WITH DEFERRED REBUILD]
[IDXPROPERTIES (property_name=property_value, ...)]
[IN TABLE index_table_name]
[PARTITIONED BY (col_name, ...)]
[
 [ ROW FORMAT ...] STORED AS ...
 | STORED BY ...
]
[LOCATION hdfs_path]
[TBLPROPERTIES (...)]

Example
Let us take an example for index. Use the same employee table that we have used earlier with the fields Id, Name, Salary, Designation, and Dept. Create an index named 
index_salary on the salary column of the employee table.The following query creates an index:
hive> CREATE INDEX inedx_salary ON TABLE employee(salary)
AS 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.index.compact.CompactIndexHandler';
It is a pointer to the salary column. If the column is modified, the changes are stored using an index value.

Dropping an Index
The following syntax is used to drop an index:
DROP INDEX <index_name> ON <table_name>
The following query drops an index named index_salary:

hive> DROP INDEX index_salary ON employee;
